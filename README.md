## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive workflow for auditing billing data in the healthcare/pharmacy sector. It leverages data analysis techniques and visualization tools to ensure data accuracy, identify discrepancies, analyze billing patterns, and generate actionable insights to improve the overall billing process.

## Problem Statement

In the healthcare industry, particularly within the pharmacy sector, accurate and efficient billing processes are crucial for financial stability and regulatory compliance. However, billing data often contains errors, inconsistencies, and patterns that, if left unaddressed, can lead to revenue loss, compliance issues, and decreased patient satisfaction.

This project aims to address these challenges by providing a robust framework for auditing and analyzing healthcare billing data.

## Features

- Data loading and validation
- Comprehensive billing analysis
- Data visualization
- Automated report generation
- Identification of data quality issues
- Detection of billing patterns and anomalies

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-billing-audit.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd healthcare-billing-audit
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Healthcare Billing Audit Analysis:

1. Ensure you have your billing data in an Excel format (.xlsx) in the project directory.

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Healthcare_Billing_Audit_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook cells to perform the analysis, generate visualizations, and create the final report.

## Data

The project uses a sample dataset (`Dataset.xlsx`) containing healthcare billing information. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Account ID
- Customer Name
- Billing Date
- Amount
- Status
- Description
- Department

Ensure your data follows a similar structure for the analysis to work correctly.

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis is divided into several key steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The billing data is loaded from the Excel file.
2. **Data Validation**: Checks for missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.
3. **Billing Analysis**: Performs statistical analysis on the billing data.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creates visual representations of key insights.
5. **Report Generation**: Produces a comprehensive audit report.

## Visualizations

The project generates several visualizations to aid in the analysis:

1. Distribution of Billing Amounts by Department
2. Distribution of Transaction Statuses
3. Monthly Billing Totals

These visualizations are saved as PNG files in the `output/` directory.

## Report Generation

The final step of the analysis is the generation of a comprehensive billing audit report. This report includes:

- Data overview
- Data quality issues
- Billing analysis results
- Key insights and findings

The report is saved as `billing_audit_report.txt` in the `output/` directory.
